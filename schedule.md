		<h6>Bad Data and Epidemiology</h6>
		<p>Laura Stokes completed their Ph.D. at the University of Virginia in 2006.

		Their current research is an examination of quotidian economic culture during the fifteenth through seventeenth centuries. This project, under the working title A Social History of Greed in the Age of the Reformation, is based largely on the examination of court depositions from the city of Basel. Its first fruit will be a microhistory on The Murder of Uly Mörnach, currently in process.</p>

		<h6>A Decolonial Perspective on Archives and Digital Practices</h6>
		<p>Christina J. Hodge is Academic Curator and Collections Manager of the Stanford University Archaeology Collections (SUAC) of the Stanford Archaeology Center, a museum collection of over 100,000 archaeological, ethnographic, and art objects from California and around the world.
