<p>Computational and Data Sciences approaches must balance urges to generalize data for purposes of standardization and prediction with the need to recognize individual and specific significance. Critical voices have revealed algorithmic biases and marginalization that have shaped and influenced new technology. Current works in law and policy studies ask whether fairness can be calculated and automated in civil society. Recently published work in art history looks to medieval Italy to reveal how measurement itself molds our understanding of truth and accuracy, while research on the extensive history of human communication demonstrates, from massive datasets, how particular events in society, and the effect of one group’s decision-making, can change the course of technological evolution. Against this backdrop, rapidly emerging techniques in Artificial and Augmented Intelligence--specifically, the advance of deep learning--is shifting focus from dataset size to data qualities and to the continuing significance of carefully and manually curated data. Designing effective models requires intimate engagement among data science experts and domain experts in the humanities and social sciences, the latter of whom understand the nuances and interpretative potential of underlying data and the kind of open questions that can be asked of it. The definition of data across disciplines remains arbitrary and ambiguous and assumptions about data are rooted in disciplinary and subjective practices. This working group will critically investigate data practices as a bridge to understanding data’s role in developing new insights and innovative solutions that encourage knowledge transfer not only among disciplines but between the academic and community engagement worlds. The group will investigate the ways data extracted from cultural artifacts, writings, and observations can be transformed into new knowledge that positively impacts scholarly understanding of the human in the machine.</p>
